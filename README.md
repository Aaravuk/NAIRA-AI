# GHOST AI Assistant - Fullstack Program

This project is inspired by the development blueprint for **NAIRA (Networked Adaptive Intelligent Responsive Assistant)**, a next-generation personal AI assistant conceptualized to mirror the intelligence, adaptability, and human-like interaction style of JARVIS from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. GHOST is a functional prototype of such an assistant, built using Python (Flask) and basic web technologies, aimed at providing intelligent, responsive task management and interaction.

## 🔥 Core Concept
GHOST is an intelligent assistant designed to manage your daily tasks, process commands, and offer a conversational interface with contextual awareness and adaptability.

## ✨ Features & Characteristics
- **No API Key Required**: This version uses rule-based responses and local logic, functioning without internet APIs.
- **Natural Interaction**: Provides conversational fluency through a friendly chat interface.
- **Logging Capability**: Every interaction is recorded with a timestamp in `ghost_tasks.log`.
- **Extensible Design**: Built for future integration with AI models, voice input, device control, and more.

## 🔧 Functional Capabilities
- Task Logging & History
- Chat UI Interface
- Modular Backend using Flask
- Frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Cross-browser compatibility
